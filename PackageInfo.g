##  PackageInfo.g for the package `Example'                     Werner Nickel
##                                                                Greg Gamble
##  (created from Frank Lübeck's PackageInfo.g template file)
##  
##  This is a GAP readable file. Of course you can change and remove all
##  comments as you like.
##  
##  This file contains meta-information on the package. It is used by
##  the package loading mechanism and the upgrade mechanism for the
##  redistribution of the package via the GAP website.
##  
##  Entries that are commented out are based on the EDIM package and 
##  are there for purposes of illustration of a possible alternative,
##  especially in the case where the Example package's entry is blank.
##  
##  For the LoadPackage mechanism in GAP >= 4.5 the minimal set of needed
##  entries is .PackageName and .Version, and an error
##  will occur if any of them is missing. Other important entries are
##  .PackageDoc and .Dependencies. The other entries are relevant if the
##  package will be distributed for other GAP users, in particular if it
##  will be redistributed via the GAP Website.
##
##  With a new release of the package at least the entries .Version, .Date 
##  and .ArchiveURL must be updated.

##  The fields 'Status', 'CommunicatedBy' and 'AcceptDate' are obsolete since

##  other two fields even in that case.

##  For a central overview of all packages and a collection of all package
##  archives it is necessary to have two files accessible which should be
##  contained in each package:
##     - A README file, containing a short abstract about the package
##       content and installation instructions.
##     - The PackageInfo.g file you are currently reading or editing!
##  You must specify URLs for these two files, these allow to automate 
##  the updating of package information on the GAP Website, and inclusion
##  and updating of the package in the GAP distribution.
#
README_URL := 
  Concatenation( ~.PackageWWWHome, "/README.md" ),
PackageInfoURL := 
  Concatenation( ~.PackageWWWHome, "/PackageInfo.g" ),

##  Provide a short (up to a few lines) abstract in HTML format, explaining
##  the package content. This text will be displayed on the package overview
##  Web page. Please use '<span class="pkgname">GAP</span>' for GAP and
##  '<span class="pkgname">MyPKG</span>' for specifying package names.
##  
# AbstractHTML := "This package provides  a collection of functions for \
# computing the Smith normal form of integer matrices and some related \
# utilities.",
AbstractHTML := 
  "The <span class=\"pkgname\">Example</span> package, as its name suggests, \
   is an example of how to create a <span class=\"pkgname\">GAP</span> \
   package. It has little functionality except for being a package.",

##  Here is the information on the help book(s) of the package, used for
##  loading into GAP's online help and maybe for an online copy of the 
##  documentation on the GAP website.
##  
##  For the online help the following is needed:
##       - the name of the book (.BookName)
##       - a long title, shown by ?books (.LongTitle, optional)
##       - the path to the manual.six file for this book (.SixFile)
##  
##  For an online version on a Web page further entries are needed, 
##  if possible, provide an HTML- and a PDF-version:
##      - if there is an HTML-version the path to the start file,
##        relative to the package home directory (.HTMLStart)
##      - if there is a PDF-version the path to the .pdf-file,
##        relative to the package home directory (.PDFFile)
##      - give the paths to the files inside your package directory
##        which are needed for the online manual (as a list 
##        .ArchiveURLSubset of names of directories and/or files which 
##        should be copied from your package archive, given in .ArchiveURL 
##        above (in most cases, ["doc"] or ["doc","htm"] suffices).
##  
##  For links to other GAP or package manuals you can assume a relative 
##  position of the files as in a standard GAP installation.
##  
# in case of several help books give a list of such records here:
PackageDoc := rec(
  BookName  := "Example",
  ArchiveURLSubset := ["doc"],
  HTMLStart := "doc/chap0_mj.html",
  PDFFile   := "doc/manual.pdf",
  # the path to the .six file used by GAP's help system
  SixFile   := "doc/manual.six",
  # a longer title of the book, this together with the book name should
  # fit on a single text line (appears with the '?books' command in GAP)
  # LongTitle := "Elementary Divisors of Integer Matrices",
  LongTitle := "Example/Template of a GAP Package",
),


##  Are there restrictions on the operating system for this package? Or does
##  the package need other packages to be available?
Dependencies := rec(
  # GAP version, use the version string for specifying a least version,
  # prepend a '=' for specifying an exact version.
  GAP := "4.11",

  # list of pairs [package name, version], package name is case
  # insensitive, exact version denoted with '=' prepended to version string.
  # without these, the package will not load
  # NeededOtherPackages := [["GAPDoc", "1.5"]],
  NeededOtherPackages := [["GAPDoc", "1.5"]],

  # list of pairs [package name, version] as above,
  # these package are will be loaded if they are available,
  # but the current package will be loaded if they are not available
  # SuggestedOtherPackages := [],
  SuggestedOtherPackages := [],

  # needed external conditions (programs, operating system, ...)  provide 
  # just strings as text or
  # pairs [text, URL] where URL  provides further information
  # about that point.
  # (no automatic test will be done for this, do this in your 
  # 'AvailabilityTest' function below)
  # ExternalConditions := []
  ExternalConditions := []
),

##  *Optional*:
##  Provide a test function for the availability of this package.
##  For packages containing nothing but GAP code, just say 'ReturnTrue' here
##  (this is also the default value since GAP 4.14).
##  For packages which may not work or will have only partial functionality,
##  use 'LogPackageLoadingMessage( PACKAGE_WARNING, ... )' statements to
##  store messages which may be viewed later with `DisplayPackageLoadingLog'.
##  Do not call `Print' or `Info' in the `AvailabilityTest' function of the 
##  package.
##
##  With the package loading mechanism of GAP >=4.4, the availability
##  tests of other packages, as given under .Dependencies above, will be 
##  done automatically and need not be included in this function.
##
##  Note that this field is optional since GAP 4.14 but was required
##  before. If compatibility with older GAP versions is desired, set it
##  explicitly to `ReturnTrue`.
##
#AvailabilityTest := ReturnTrue,
AvailabilityTest := function()
  local path, file;
    # test for existence of the compiled binary
    path:= DirectoriesPackagePrograms( "example" );
    file:= Filename( path, "hello" );
    if file = fail then
      LogPackageLoadingMessage( PACKAGE_WARNING,
          [ "The program `hello' is not compiled,",
            "`HelloWorld()' is thus unavailable.",
            "See the installation instructions;",
            "type: ?Installing the Example package" ] );
    fi;
    # if the hello binary was vital to the package we would return
    # the following ...
    # return file <> fail;
    # since the hello binary is not vital we return ...
    return true;
  end,

##  *Optional*: the LoadPackage mechanism produces a nice default banner from
##  the info in this file. Normally, there is no need to change it, and we
##  recommend that you don't as this minimizes work for everybody (you and the
##  GAP team) on the long run.
##
##  However, if you reall think that you need a custom banner, you can provide
##  a string here that is used as a banner. GAP decides when the banner is 
##  shown and when it is not shown (note the ~-syntax in this example).
# BannerString := Concatenation( 
#     "----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
#     "Loading  Example ", ~.Version, "\n",
#     "by ",
#     JoinStringsWithSeparator( List( Filtered( ~.Persons, r -> r.IsAuthor ),
#                                     r -> Concatenation(
#         r.FirstNames, " ", r.LastName, " (", r.WWWHome, ")\n" ) ), "   " ),
#     "For help, type: ?Example package \n",
#     "----------------------------------------------------------------\n" ),

##  *Optional*: if you need a custom BannerString but would like to include
##  information in it that is only available once your package is being loaded
##  (i.e., which is computed in your init.g file, such as the presence and
##  versions of external software your package depends on), then you can
##  use a BannerFunction instead. The difference is that the BannerString is
##  usually computed when GAP starts, i.e., long before your init.g is run.
##  While the BannerFunction is called right before the banner is to be
##  displayed, which is after your init.g has been executed.
##
# BannerFunction := function(info)
#       local l;
#       # modify the default banner string, and insert something before
#       # its last line (which is a separator string)
#       l:=SplitString(DefaultPackageBannerString(info), "\n");
#       Add(l, " ...  some extra information ... ", Length(l));
#       return JoinStringsWithSeparator(l,"\n");
#     end,

##  *Optional*, but recommended: path relative to package root to a file
##  which contains a short test (to run for no more than several minutes)
##  which may be used to check that a package works as expected.
##  This file can either consist of 'Test' calls or be a test file to be
##  read via 'Test' itself; it is assumed that the latter case occurs if
##  and only if the file contains the string 'gap> START_TEST('. For
##  deposited packages, these tests are run regularly as a part of the
##  standard GAP test suite. See  '?Tests files for a GAPpackage',
##  '?TestPackage', and also '?TestDirectory' for more information.
TestFile := "tst/testall.g",

##  *Optional*: Here you can list some keyword related to the topic 
##  of the package.
# Keywords := ["Smith normal form", "p-adic", "rational matrix inversion"]
Keywords := ["package example", "package template"],

##  *Optional*:
##  Here you can list conditional extensions which your package provides,
##  see Section "Extensions Provided by a Package" in the GAP Reference Manual.
##  For example, suppose that your package contains a function that depends
##  on some other packages, but you want your package to be loadable also
##  without these other packages (and then without your function being
##  available).
##  Then you can put the code of this function into a separate file
##  that shall be read only as soon as those other packages
##  get loaded.
##  The filename and the names of the packages in question
##  can be specified via the 'Extensions' component.
##
##  Extensions are supported since GAP 4.13 or later, older GAP versions will
##  ignore this field.
# Extensions := [],

##  *Optional*: If you are using AutoDoc, then you can specify content of
##  the manual title page it creates for you here
